My name is Tim Angus and I'm a 40-something professional software engineer, living in Edinburgh. For as long as I can remember I've been obsessed with making things. I've pretty much always got some project or other on the go, even if it's just at the idea stage. At some point, I decided that it would be a good idea to document some of these projects, and that's what this website based log is about. Maybe you could call it a web-log or shorten that to 'blog or something? I don't know, probably won't catch on. Anyway, obviously this was mostly written in retrospect, so the tenses and exact dates are probably a bit all over the place, but hopefully it's still at least a bit coherent. I'm going to *try* to keep it up to date.

Fot what it's worth, "timang", the second-level domain name of this site, is apparently the [Tagalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_language) word for "stupid" or "idiot".
