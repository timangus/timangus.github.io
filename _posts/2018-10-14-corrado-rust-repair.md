Despite sitting there idle, or perhaps *because* it was sitting there idle, I decided to address a couple of rust spots on the Corrado.

Presumably due to many years of being jacked up poorly (not by me, I hasten to add), the front jacking points were looking a bit ropey. They aren't helped by having a hole on the centre of them which happens to be directly in the firing line of the front wheels. It was a problem on both sides, in case the pictures don't make sense.

The first step is to cut out the rusted part, with the cut in good metal.

Now that it's cut out, stick it back together with tape and from that use CAD (Cardboard Aided Design) to transfer it to a template.

And from that template transfer it to metal, cutting it out and bending it into shape.

Offer it up, trim it to shape and finally weld it in.

I then coated it all liberally in a bitumen based under-seal. Technically this doesn't match the original poly-urethane based under-seal that was originally applied, but maybe it'll work a bit better? Time will tell, if I ever get around to making it roadworthy again.
