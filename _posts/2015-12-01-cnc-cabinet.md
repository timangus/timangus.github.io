In 2005 I bought a [Taig](https://taigtools.com/) CNC milling machine for no particular reason other than I wanted a milling machine. It was about $2000 shipped from the US, which in retrospect seems very expensive considering both inflation and what's available on the market now. Anyway, when I moved it to my flat I found that in the limited space I had available, some kind of cabinet was going to be essential to keep chips out of the electronics (and off the floor).

I eventually settled on a perspex box, which I later replaced with polycarbonate after I found the perspex was prone to cracking. I needed to decide on how to fashion the door. I could have had just used hinges, but the problem here is that the swept area on the door would then be quite large in the aforementioned tight space, and depending on whether I put the hinges at the top, would need supporting with gas struts. Thereafter I went down a rabbit hole of reading about 4 bar linkages, eventually learning that with a start and end state of a system, you could reverse engineer the placement of the other three bars so that the fourth bar followed a path between the two states. So that's what I did. Lots of cutting, bending and welding later:

I later added some stubby gas struts to ease opening and closing.
