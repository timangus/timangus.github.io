I wasn't really happy with the mount that came with my Garmin, it being a rather clunky affair that held the unit in an odd spot on my handle bars. I wanted it more centralised, directly above my fork steerer.

I knew that this was going to need a bit of tuning, so from the outset I designed it with parametric parameters, allowing me to tweak all the various offsets so I could get the perfect position. I'd obviously surveyed existing Garmin mounts (and there are many) but none of them really fit the bill for me. In particular, the actual mechanism in other models is usually flawed in one of two ways:

* the intended print orientation is horizontal, thus mandating support structures that are difficult to remove and leave residual filament that interferes with the operation of the interface
* the intended print orientation is vertical, exposing the flexible part of the interface to weakness due to lack of layer bonding

What I've come up with is a multi piece design that prints without support, and is then assembled after printing. That way, you get decent surface finish because of the lack of support, but also good layer adhesion because it's all printing horizontally.

It's a print-in-place design with an integrated hinge, requiring no supports. I've uploaded it to the [usual place](https://www.printables.com/model/156668-yet-another-garminwahoo-bike-handlebar-mount) in various versions and dimensions; at the time of writing it's my most popular model.

I've also split out the main interface into its own [model](https://www.printables.com/model/156670-3d-printing-friendly-garminwahoo-interface), which has spawned a bunch of [derivatives](https://www.printables.com/model/156670-3d-printing-friendly-garminwahoo-interface/remixes).
