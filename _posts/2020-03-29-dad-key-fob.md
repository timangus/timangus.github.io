Lock down had kicked in and it was my Dad's 70th birthday. What could I get him? Mum suggested I make some key fobs for his various vehicles. So that's what I did.

First I made a bunch of simple key fob blanks, then I made an fixture that could hold a blank in a repeatable position using the [superglue and tape](https://hackaday.com/2018/03/29/super-blue-cnc-part-fixturing/) trick.

I think I used this fixture to put the chamfers on. Maybe not, can't remember. It was definitely used for the engraving though.

This was done with a pretty crude engraving D-bit. I don't think I've ever sharpened it, but it just keeps on truckin'. Here's the camper van after a little bit of sanding to remove the machining marks and WD-40 to flush out the chips.

And here's the Piaggio Ape.
