Having ruined the Haro, in 2018 I bought my first ever completely new mountain bike, a [Deviate Guide](https://www.deviatecycles.com/guide). I've always had a thing for gearbox based mountain bikes, but this was the first one that was equipped with a [Pinion](https://pinion.eu/).

The following May, on a particularly rocky descent in the Cairngorms, the plastic cover on the shifting mechanism of the Pinion parted ways, exposing the greased up microscopic planetary gears to the elements. Not ideal. Being away on a trip, I didn't have my usual set of tools available to me, so I resorted to the fundamentals; duct tape, zip ties and beer (cans).

The underlying design of this cover is(/was?) fundamentally weak, in my opinion; it really needs at least a screw or something to positively hold it in place. This turned out to not be a problem for me going forward as I replaced the entire shifting mechanism with [something else](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1769923126/cinq-shift-r-for-pinion), but not before I modelled up a like for like 3D printable [replacement](https://www.printables.com/model/156674-cover-for-pinion-c-line-bicycle-gearbox), because of course I did.
