I bought a [Mitutoyo](https://www.mitutoyo.co.uk/) dial indicator to replace the shitty cheap one I had been using. I didn't pay full price, getting it second hand from eBay -- it didn't come with a case.

If I didn't get a case it would inevitably end up getting crunched on something or other, so I broke out [Fusion](https://www.autodesk.com/uk/products/fusion-360) and designed [one](https://www.printables.com/model/304725-case-for-mitutoyo-no-2046f-dial-indicator).

The most interesting part of the case is the latch, designed both to print without support and to be springy so that it flexes open and shut.

I put a [parametric version](https://www.printables.com/model/304757-parametric-casebox-with-clip-latch) up on Printables for other people to use, but I've also used it myself to make various other [derivatives](https://www.printables.com/model/304757-parametric-casebox-with-clip-latch/remixes).
