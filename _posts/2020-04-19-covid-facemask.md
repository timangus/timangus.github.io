COVID was in full swing and our politicians were [busy giving their mates](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg6r7zk47eo) back handers rather than dealing with the inevitable PPE shortage, so there was a [community effort](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52201696) to produce 3D printed face visors.

The design that was eventually settled on was a simple one that joined up to a hole punched sheet of acetate. I printed a bunch of them.

Quite a lot of them.

Loads in fact.

Obviously not a lot of making on my part here other than pressing go every now and then, though I do remember spending time tweaking the printing profile to churn them out as fast as possible. Local to me was a 3D printing job shop called [Open Factory](https://www.instagram.com/open_factory/p/B_SbWNSDgIJ/), now sadly wound up. This is where I dropped my produce off; what happened to them after that is unknown to me. I did get first hand accounts of them having been useful from a couple of health care workers I knew though, so that's good to know.
