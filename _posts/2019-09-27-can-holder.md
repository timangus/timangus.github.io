Sick of constantly kicking various spray cans over on the floor of my garage I decided I needed some way to get them mounted on the wall and easily accessible.

I wasn't sure exactly how many cans I needed to deal with, so thought it might be an idea to make an extensible system where two or more holders could be slotted together and screwed to the wall. The result works quite well, but is a bit fragile. I designed it to use a minimum of material and thus be relatively quick to print, but obviously there are downsides to this. I might revisit this idea at some point, but as ever you can get it on [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/156673-spray-can-holder-wall-mount) for now.
