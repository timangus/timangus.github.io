I got some new speakers to replace the ancient old ones I had had since literally the 90s. Unfortunately I misread the stated dimensions and they didn't fit where I intended them to.

Luckily I have a 3D printer, so I made some simple [brackets](https://www.printables.com/model/217019-creative-t100-mounting-brackets) to suspend the speakers (side on) from the underside of my desktop monitor stand.
