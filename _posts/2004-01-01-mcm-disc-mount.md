I got this bike during university, probably 2002, using my student loan (obviously, what else is it for?). It's a Giant MCM-D 990, an eBay find (Â£500!) and clearly about 2 sizes too small for me, but it was quite a distinctive thing and always got lots of questions and comments out on the trails. The front triangle is carbon fibre, which was very unusual at the time.

Because it was made in the 90s it predates disc brake mounts, so I was stuck with V-brakes on the rear.

Stuck that is, unless I fabricated my own and had it welded on (this predates me getting a welder, or the skill to use one).

It cracked at some point, unsurprising in hindsight given the lack of weld prep that I put into the part and the problems with welding Aluminium in general. I made an excessively big chunky gusset and it went back to the welder, and gave me no trouble afterwards.

I still have the frame in my garage somewhere. I really ought to move it on or mount it on a wall or something...
