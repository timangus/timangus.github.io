Following a protracted purchasing debacle partly in thanks (genuinely thanks, in terms of sale price) to the global financial crisis, I bought my first flat in December 2008. It had been owned by a minister in his 90s, and was not in the best of shape. The kitchen had a small stand alone fridge, inside of which was a solitary egg and pungent aroma. I discarded the fridge and its contents.

And that was just me getting started, I threw out virtually the entire contents of the place, it was so bad. At least two skips' worth. People use the term "gutted" with respect to property and I think in my case that would be appropriate. Seriously, I left almost nothing, the pine ceilings, decades old wiring, squint stud walls, it all had to go, it was all so horrid. What I was left with was a decent blank canvas. Importantly it has an attached garage and space for a small workshop; crucial facilities as far as I'm concerned.

Except for a short period where I was distracted repairing a certain [vehicle]({% post_url 2008-01-01-corrado %}), for 3 years I spent almost every weekend renovating. Then between jobs I took a stretch off to work on it full time for a few months, in 2012. That's when it mostly got done. There's too much to describe in detail, and it's not really that interesting anyway, just standard renovation stuff for the most part, but here are some pictures:
