Very occasionally I do a bit of sim racing, by which I mean just driving virtual cars round virtual tracks, on my own, in virtual reality. As such I own a [Logitech G-29](https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html) wheel -- not the cheapest, but not far off it. As an occasional user, I don't have a permanent setup. Despite its affordability, the G-29 does not really lend itself toward being setup temporarily, as it involves multiple cables trailing about the floor. To avoid this I made a breakout box that's screwed to the bottom of my desk, with sockets for the wheel and gear shifter, which I connect with a custom loom. This in itself isn't all that interesting (it's just a box), but said custom loom needs to connect to the wheel, and there is precious little space under there to do so.

What I needed was a backshell for a [DSUB connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature) (what Logitech uses) that is shallow enough that it doesn't physically conflict with anything. There didn't appear to be any obvious source of commercially available housings that satisfied these criteria, so I made my own. I only actually needed the DE9 version, but doing a DA15 and DB25 at the same time was very little work.

They're on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/156664-db9-db15-db25-dsub-connector-low-profile-housing-s). Weirdly enough someone has commented on it saying they are using it for their own Logitech wheel, despite me not having mentioned this is what I made it for in the model description.
