At some point I indulged in a [GoPro](https://gopro.com/), on a whim. It came with a stick on mount for the top of a helmet, but I found this produced odd looking top down shots. There must be a better way I thought.

That being a chin mount; I'm not claiming to have invented the idea. I made this particular model in part because the slicer I was using at the time ([Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/)) had just introduced tree supports, and I was curious if that freed up restrictions in the design process. You *could* print this with traditional rectilinear support structures, but they'd be a gigantic pain in the arse to remove. The tree supports did indeed work though. I rarely use support, preferring to design around the problem. As far as I remember I've only ever actually used this mount in anger once, possibly because my GoPro is so horrifically unreliable, and very picky about what SD cards it likes. Plenty of [other](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4389872) [people](https://www.printables.com/model/156672-gopro-chin-mount-for-bell-super-3r) seem to have found it useful though.
