In a [previous post]({% post_url 1998-01-01-guitar %}) I discussed making an electric guitar. One thing I didn't cover there is integrating a [Roland GK split pickup](https://www.musewiki.org/Roland_GK-2A_Guitar_Synthesizer_Driver) that I had acquired cheaply through a friend. This enabled MIDI guitar, among other things. These days Roland make a version of the system suitable for OEMs such that their pickup can be neatly integrated into guitars, but at this time the only option was the incredibly ugly GK-2A. This wasn't going to fly with me, so I took it to bits and modified it, originally fitting it to an aluminium bracket that sat under the bridge. I was never 100% happy with the result though and now I had a 3D printer this aspect of my guitar was ripe for improvement.

The basic idea was that the previous cut down plastic base, folded over sheet metal cover and aluminium bracket (sadly I don't have any closeups) would all be a replaced with a plastic enclosure that is glued to the underside of the bridge.

Of course there were inevitably many prototypes.

After carefully wet sanding it to get rid of layer lines it came out quite nice, and definitely much better than what it replaced.
