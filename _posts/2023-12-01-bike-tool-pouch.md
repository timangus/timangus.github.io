When I go out on my road bike I don't carry a back pack or any other sort of bag, so I'm limited to what I can put in my jersey pockets. Tool wise, I take the bare minimum; a multi-tool, a tube and an inflator. Rather than have all these jangling about in one or more pockets, I wanted a way to hold them together, both to reduce jangling, but also meaning I had fewer things to remember.

Here's [what I came up with](https://www.printables.com/model/666101-road-bike-emergency-tool-pouch). It uses the slicer's *vase mode*, which basically means that when presented with a solid object, the output will be a hollowed out version with an open top, resembling a vase. This uses literally the minimum amount of filament and thus weighs very little. It also prints rapidly.

Thankfully I haven't needed to use its contents yet. In saying that I've probably now jinxed it.
