Around about the summer of 2017, the engine of the Corrado started making a bit of an alarming noise. At first I thought it was just tappets; it seemed to go away after it warmed up only to come back with a vengeance later. Peering in the filler, the oil looked OK. Then it got worse. Much worse. Long story short, one of the rod bearings on the big end had spun. There was now ample evidence of this given the even distribution of flakes of bearing material throughout the oil.

I judged it not worth repairing, so out it came.

I eventually managed to get a replacement from someone off [The Corrado Forum](https://the-corrado.net/) for a very very reasonable Â£500. Honestly I was just pissed off with the thing at this point and didn't really take many photos. I did set up my GoPro though, and time-lapsed the later stages of replacing the engine.

I put off getting an MOT until the following spring because it was cold and dark, and that's where it's sat ever since. I don't really drive much anyway. One of these days I'll put it back on the road; shouldn't take much.
