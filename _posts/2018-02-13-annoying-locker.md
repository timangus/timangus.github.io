One of my old work places had a changing room for those of us who [got sweaty](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1055459) commuting to work, which was great, but the lockers had these incredibly annoying spring loaded hinges that, with your hands full made it very frustrating to get things in and out of them. When you have a 3D printer, there's a phenomenon where suddenly you find solutions popping into your head for minor day-to-day problems such as this.

I made a silly YouTube video to document this. A video says 1000 words? Something like that.

It got quite a good response on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/7xu0wz/fixing_my_stupid_locker_with_a_3d_printer/).
