Having got into the mindset of [improving]({% post_url 2018-02-18-gk-split-pickup %}) bits of my guitar, I turned my attention some of the mounting of the controls, as the job I did originally left a bit to be desired.

Originally I had made a little aluminium bracket that held the GK volume potentiometer such that it could pivot from side to side, with its case pushing on two momentary action buttons for the up/down GK controls, thereby integrating three separate controls into one, both saving space on the guitar itself and improving its aesthetics. It never really worked 100% though, and the buttons needed shimming to get them to close adequately. I'm sure I could have made it work had I had the perseverance to make a prototype and then refine it, but making things out of metal is time consuming and what I had approximately worked so I left it at that.

Fast forward 20 years, and 3D printing makes it easy to prototype and experiment, ultimately resulting in a [much better solution](https://www.printables.com/model/156678-potentiometer-with-2-tactile-switches).

At the same time I refreshed all the frankly shocking soldering, and 3D printed a mounting system for the sockets and controls that live on the side of the guitar, replacing a bit of sheet metal that worked, but was far from robust.

Rather than go through exactly what I did in words, it's easier explained in video, suffice it to say there are various clips that snap into place to hold things securely.

It's a pretty tight squeeze in there.

Eventually I also got around to remaking a stainless cover plate that hides the 3D print and improves the look a little.
