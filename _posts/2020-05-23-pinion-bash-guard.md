Such is the mounting position of the [Pinion](https://pinion.eu) gearbox in my [Deviate Guide](https://www.deviatecycles.com/guide) that occasionally it hits the undergrowth, or worse. Its case is a cast magnesium alloy so probably not all that resilient to impacts. I thought a simple bash guard wouldn't go amiss.

There's not much to this really, it's just a [bit of plastic](https://www.printables.com/model/156667-bash-guard-for-pinion-on-deviate-guide) that matches the contours of the underside of the gearbox, with some drainage holes.

Getting it to actually fit was quite a challenge, but it was a good opportunity to learn about the surface features of [Fusion](https://www.autodesk.com/uk/products/fusion-360).

I'm not sure it would really do much under a significant impact. I'm not actually using this specific gearbox any more, and when it came off the bike the bash guard had definitely taken some bashing, so who knows? Possibly it would be better printed in a flexible filament that has a little give to it, potentially reducing point loads.
