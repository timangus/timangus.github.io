One of the main reasons I bought my flat (I'm not even exaggerating) is that it had a space on the ground floor which I could use as a small workshop. First I had to turn it into a workshop though.

I remember getting the steel and thinking I'd miscalculated; seemed like way too much versus my plans, but nope I had it right. I'm sure my neighbours appreciated all the angle grinding this involved.

I got this lovely sturdy vice from somewhere. It's a Record 25 with quick release.

Worktops recovered from my Dad's storage facility (his garage).

I put some shelves in high up to maximise the space I could use. It really is quite small, perhaps 6 square metres or so.

Phone cameras at the time only had fairly long lenses, so it was difficult to take a picture of the whole thing at once, here's a stitch:

Here's my Taig milling machine installed; this turned out to be inadequate in various ways, I'll get back to that.
