When I was about 9 or so, I got my sweaty little mitts on an Usbourne book _Fun With Electronics_, from a children's book shop that used to be on Comiston Road.

I made many (most?) of the projects in the book, but I don't have any of them any more. The one that I do still have was this medium wave radio, but I think I got that from a different book. I remember showing it to my teacher in primary 6 (yes, I was that child.)
