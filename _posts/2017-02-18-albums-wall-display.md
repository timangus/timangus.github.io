As a teenager in the late 90s, a lot of the music that I owned was on vinyl thanks to it being much more affordable than getting it on CD. Who could have predicted how that vinyl would become fashionable again? Anyway I digress, I'd had this vinyl sitting in a pile for 15 years. I should do something with it, I thought.

Why not put it on the wall? They're held up there by strips of 20x20mm pine, with a groove ripped up them. The wood is fixed to the wall using [command strips](https://command.3m.co.uk/3M/en_GB/command-gb/).

Unfortunately the timber isn't that straight so it has a tendency to lean, particularly when the heating has been on. Every now and again one of the albums falls off the wall and scares the shit out of me. If I was to do it again I'd probably have a retaining strip of wood on top of the albums, so them staying in place is not down to gravity alone.
