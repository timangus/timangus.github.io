I wanted a holder/charging dock for my phone to sit in over night. Go-go-gadget 3D printing.

There's not a great deal to say beyond what is explaining in the pictures. It's designed to take a generic (but specific) USB cable, holding it in place by an S-shaped channel in the base. Originally I made it for the [phone](https://www.fxtec.com/smartphones/pro1x) I was using at the time, but later on I reworked it to be [parametric](https://www.printables.com/model/403233-parametric-phone-charging-cradlestanddock).
