For a couple of years I had a very niche bike frame, a Haro Sonix. This hybrid URT design was... odd. To compound the oddness I fitted it with a [Rohloff](https://www.rohloff.de/) Speedhub. Assuming the presence of a derailleur, the frame had no chain tensioning device.
Time to add one.

At great expense, I bought a [Phil Wood](https://philwood.com/) Eccentric Bottom Bracket. The idea of these things is that kind of like a cam, they can be rotated to increase the effective distance between the BB and the rear axle. Unfortunately, it didn't fit the frame! No worries, it nearly fits, I can adjust it.

The old triple ring crankset I was using also needed some "adjustment".
